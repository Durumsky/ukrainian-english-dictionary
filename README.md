## ⚠️ Limitations / Known Issues

Kindle dictionary lookup is strict:

- Kindle does **not** perform full lemmatization  
  (inflected forms may fail unless explicitly present)
- Some rare or irregular wordforms may not be recognized
- The dictionary focuses on headwords rather than exhaustive morphology
- Due to problems with OCR and data cleasing over printed old dictionaries, there are errors in some translations.

## 🔧 How this dictionary was created

This dictionary was generated through a reproducible pipeline:

1. Import of a Ukrainian → English combined vocabulary CSV  
2. Expansion using **12 Ukrainian fiction books**:
   - extraction of the **20,000 most frequent additional wordforms**
   - removal of duplicates and merging with the base dataset  
3. Cleaning and normalization:
   - Unicode NFC normalization  
   - removal of invalid/invisible characters  
4. Translation enrichment:
   - missing definitions generated automatically via an external **LLM API**  
5. Kindle dictionary formatting:
   - `dictionary.html` built using the official KDP structure  
   - `dictionary.opf` metadata (`uk → en`, proper lookup index)  
6. Final compilation into `.mobi` using **Kindle Previewer 3**
